## Vision
Build the lightest, most seamless bridge between AI coding agents and live Flutter web apps — enabling continuous observation, interaction, code-hot-reload loops, and optional direct tool calling.

## Milestones

### v0.1.0 — Core MVP (Q1 2026)
- [ ] Basic plugin installation + session launch
- [ ] Enhanced accessibility snapshots with Flutter-specific semantics
- [ ] Streaming of console logs, network, layout changes, jank
- [ ] Full interaction support (click, fill, scroll, etc.)
- [ ] Auto hot-reload on code save + change confirmation streams
- [ ] Headed/headless + reset session
- [ ] Basic boilerplate + bootstrap command
- [ ] Initial test suite coverage

### v0.2.0 — Tool Exposure (Q1 2026)
- [ ] Publish `flutter_agent_tools` package (annotations + code-gen registry)
- [ ] Debug-only JS interop bridge
- [ ] Auto-discovery + manifest of exposed tools
- [ ] `call-tool` and `list-tools` commands
- [ ] Auto-CRUD bonus for standard method names
- [ ] Enhanced seeding/reset via tools
- [ ] Full end-to-end tests for tool flow

### v0.3.0 — Polish & Ecosystem (Q2 2026)
- [ ] WASM/skwasm auto-detection + recommendations
- [ ] Better error streaming + recovery suggestions
- [ ] Integration guides for Cursor, Claude Code, Aider
- [ ] Optional VM Service proxy for deeper widget tree (if needed)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks + docs

### Future Ideas (v1.0+)
- MCP compatibility mode for remote agents
- Multi-session/tab management
- Screenshot diffing for visual regression
- Community skills marketplace
- Native Flutter mobile extension (long-term)

We move fast — prioritizing feedback from early users.
